  <h2>4.1 The Global Context: International Crime and Social Control</h2>
  <p>Several facts about crime throughout the world:</p>

<ul>
<li>There is no country without crime.</li>
<li>Most countries have the same components in their criminal justice systems: police, courts, and prisons.</li>
<li>Adult males make up the largest category of crime suspects.</li>
<li>In all countries theft is the most common crime committed and violent crime is a relatively rare event.</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section class='class' data-state='' id='gc1'>
  <h2>4.1 The Global Context: International Crime and Social Control</h2>
  <p>In 2010, globally, there were over 450,000 homicides:</p>

<ol>
<li>About 1/3 are estimated to have occurred in Africa</li>
<li>1/3 are estimated to have occurred in the Americas</li>
<li>And 1/3 in Asia, Europe, and Oceana</li>
</ol>

</section>
<section class='class' data-state='' id='gc2'>
  <h2>4.1 The Global Context: International Crime and Social Control</h2>
  <p>Crime rates, the number of particular crimes per 100,000 people in a population, take into consideration differences in population size and are more accurate.</p>

<ol>
<li>Countries with higher inequality tend to have higher homicide rates, </li>
<li>While more egalitarian countries have lower homicide rates.</li>
</ol>

  <h2>4.1 The Global Context: International Crime and Social Control</h2>
  <ul>
<li><strong>Transnational crime:</strong> </li>
</ul>

<p>As defined by the U.S. Department of Justice, <strong>transnational crime</strong> is “organized criminal activity across one or more national borders” (U.S. Department of Justice 2003). </p>

  <h2>4.1 The Global Context: International Crime and Social Control</h2>
  <p>A. Similarities in international crime </p>

<ol>

<li> Most countries have police, courts, and prisons.</li>
<li> Adult males comprise the largest category of crime suspects.</li>
<li> Theft is most common crime worldwide.</li>

  <h2>4.1 The Global Context: International Crime and Social Control</h2>
  <p>B.  Differences in international crime rates</p>

<ol>
<li> Dramatic differences exist in international crime rates, although comparisons are made difficult by variations in measurement and crime definitions.</li>
</ol>

</section>
<section class='class' data-state='' id='gc5'>
  <h2>4.1 The Global Context: International Crime and Social Control</h2>
  <p>C.  Global priority areas</p>

<ol>
<li> Global priority areas: drugs and criminal organizations (e.g., drug trafficking); financial and high tech crimes (e.g., counterfeiting, fraud, and cyber-crime); tracing fugitives; countering terrorism; trafficking human beings; fighting corruption </li>
<li> Each priority area contains a relatively new category of crimes—transnational crime, defined as organized criminal activity across one or more national borders (e.g., Internet child pornography; human trafficking). </li>
</ol>

  <h2>4.2 Sources of Crime Statistics</h2>
  <h3>What is Crime?</h3>

<p>A violation of a federal, state or local criminal law. The three major types of statistics used to measure crime are: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>official statistics</p></li>
<li><p>victimization surveys</p></li>
<li><p>self-report offender surveys. </p></li>
</ol>

</section>
<section class='class' data-state='' id='sources1'>
  <h2>4.2 Sources of Crime Statistics: Official Statistics</h2>
  <p>The Uniform Crime Report – Annually compiled by the FBI:</p>

<p>FBI compiles reported crimes and arrests annually and publishes them in the Uniform Crime Reports (UCR), which lists:  </p>

<ol>
<li>Crime rates (number of crimes per 100,000 population)</li>
<li>Actual number of crimes</li>
<li>Percentage of change over time : Clearance Rate</li>
</ol>

</section>
<section class='class' data-state='' id='sources2'>
  <h2>4.2 Sources of Crime Statistics: Problems of Official Statistics</h2>
  <ol>
<li> Many crimes are not reported to police.</li>
<li> Incorrect recordings.</li>
<li> Motivations for distorting crime statistics come from the public, political officials, and organizational pressures (e.g., police may “crack down” on certain crimes in election year).</li>
</ol>

</section>
<section class='class' data-state='' id='sources3'>
  <h2>4.2 Sources of Crime Statistics: Victamization Surveys</h2>
  <ol>
<li> The National Crime Victimization Survey, begun in 1973 and conducted annually by the U.S. Department of Justice, interviews over 135,000 people about their experiences as victims of crime.</li>
<li> Interviewers collect information on demographic characteristics of crime victims; relationship to offender; and extent to which victim was harmed.</li>
<li> Victimization surveys provide more information on victims than offenders. </li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>  In 2011: 508 million violent crimes and 1547.1 million property crimes<br></li>
</ul>

</section>
<section class='class' data-state='' id='sources4'>
  <h2>4.2 Sources of Crime Statistics: Self-Report Offender Surveys</h2>
  <ol>
<li> Ask offenders about their criminal behavior.</li>
<li> Sample may be known offenders or the general population.</li>
<li> Self-report surveys reveal virtually every adult has engaged in some type of criminal behavior, but only a small proportion of the total population of law violators is ever convicted of a crime.</li>
<li> May still be subject to exaggeration and concealment. </li>
</ol>

</section>
<section class='class' data-state='' id='sources5'>
  <h2>4.3 Sociological Theories of Crime: Structural-Functionalist</h2>
  <p>According to Durkheim and other functionalists, crime can have the following functions for society:</p>

<ul>
<li>Strengthens group cohesion and can lead to social change</li>
</ul>

<p>Structural functionalist is a perspective and not a theory of crime.  There are three functionalist theories of crime:</p>

<ul>
<li>Merton’s Strain Theory</li>
<li>Subcultural Theories</li>
<li>Control Theories:

<ul>
<li>attachment, commitment, involvement, belief</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

</section>
<section class='class' data-state='' id='theories'>
  <h2>4.3 Sociological Theories of Crime: Conflict</h2>
  <ul>
<li>Social inequality leads to crimes as means of economic survival.</li>
<li>Those in power define what is criminal.</li>
<li>Law enforcement penalizes those without power and benefits those with power.</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section class='class' data-state='' id='theories2'>
  <h2>4.3 Sociological Theories of Crime: Symbolic Interactionist</h2>
  <ul>
<li>Labeling theory</li>
<li>Primary and secondary deviance</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>The person who is labeled as deviant is often denied opportunities for engaging in non-deviant behavior</li>
<li>The labeled person internalizes the deviant label, adopts a deviant self-concept, and acts accordingly.</li>
</ol>

</section>
<section class='class' data-state='' id='theories2'>
  <h2>4.4 Types of Crime</h2>
  <ul>
<li>Index offenses (street crimes)</li>

<li>Vice crime</li>
<li>Organized crime</li>
<li>White-collar crime</li>
<li>Computer crime </li>
<li>Juvenile delinquency</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section class='class' data-state='' id='types'>
  <h2>4.5 Demographic Patterns of Crime</h2>
  <ul>
<li>It is a universal truth that women everywhere are less likely to commit crime than men.</li>
<li>In 2011, males accounted for 73.8 percent of all arrests, 80.1 percent of all arrests for violent crime, and 62.6 percent of all arrests for property crimes.</li>
<li>Feminist criminology focuses on how the subordinate position of women in society affects their criminal behavior and victimization.</li>
<li>In general, criminal activity is more prevalent among younger people than among older people. </li>
<li>Race is a factor in who gets arrested. Minorities are disproportionately represented in official statistics. </li>
</ul>

</section>
<section class='class' data-state='' id='demo'>
  <h2>4.6 The Societal Costs of Crime and Social Control</h2>
  <ul>
<li>Crime often results in physical injury and loss of life.</li>
<li>Moreover, the U.S. Public Health Service now defines violence as one of the top health concerns facing Americans.</li>
<li>Conklin&#39;s Six Economic Costs

<ul>
<li>Direct losses from crime</li>
<li>Transferring of property</li>
<li>Criminal violence</li>
<li>Illegal expenditures</li>
<li>Prevention and protection</li>
<li>Controlling crime</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Costs include psychological and economic</li>
</ul>

<section class='class' data-state='' id='costs'>
  <h2>4.7 Strategies for Action: Crime and Social Control</h2>
  <ul>
<li>Local initiatives: youth and community programs</li>
<li>Criminal Justice Policies: deterrence</li>
<li>Legislative</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section class='class' data-state='' id='strategies'>
  <h2>4.8 Understanding Crime and Social Control</h2>
  <ul>
<li>Multilevel problem</li>
<li>Multinational problem</li>
<li>Multi-disciplinary problem</li>
<li> Support exists for both a functionalist and conflict approach to crime</li>
<li>  Recent declines in crime should not be taken as support for “get tough” approaches as there are other, more valid, explanations.</li>
<li>  Some advocate for increased prevention and restorative justice because of their effectiveness in reducing future crimes.</li>
</ul>
